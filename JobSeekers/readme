I made a simple database with a couple of tables, 
made connections between the tables, 
and filled them with pseudo-real data. 
Brought the base close to the real prototype

After creating the database, I went to www.mockaroo.com, where I created 4 .csv files filled with random data.
Then using the COPY command, which is part of postgresql, I imported the data from the .csv files into my tables
